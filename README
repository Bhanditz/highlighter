# Highlighter

This is a simple node app and chrome extension (in /public/chrome) which allows someone to share highlighted excerpts of web pages over a URL. There is no database, the page and highlight are encoded in a URL. The page is loaded in an iframe and proxied through the server in order to get around cross origin iframe policy.
